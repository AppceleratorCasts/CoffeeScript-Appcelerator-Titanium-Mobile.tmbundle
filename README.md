How to install
----

0. Install TextMate2 (um… duh?)
1. $ cd /Applications/TextMate.app/Contents/SharedSupport/Bundles
2. $ git clone git://github.com/ToQoz/CoffeeScript-Appcelerator-Titanium-Mobile.tmbundle.git

How to use
---

### Complete! ⌥⎋ *option-escape*
The completion list contains all of the `Titanium` and `Ti` API.

### Tooltips! ⌥F1 
The tips are context sensitive. Place your caret anywhere inside of a function (on the same line) and it'll work, even inside the arguments `()`!

### Complete! Type `Ti.` (optional)
*Enable this by selecting the "JavaScript Titanium Mobile" language in the bottom bar of TextMate.*

As soon as you hit the `.` (after typing `Ti`) it'll bring up the as-you-type completion list thing.

Note: If you are at the last line and click "." then the code completion list won't appear. You must leave a blank line at the end of your document.
